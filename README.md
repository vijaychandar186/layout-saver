# Layout Saver VS Code Extension

Layout Saver is a simple VS Code extension that lets you save and restore your editor layoutâ€”including tab groups, file positions, pinned tabs, and side bar visibility. Ideal for preserving your development workspace or quickly switching between tasks.

## Features

* Save the current editor layout (visible tabs, positions, and layout).
* Restore saved layouts with a single command.
* Optionally hide the side bar after restoring.
* Skips untitled or dirty tabs for safe restoring.

| ------------- | ----------- | -------------------------------- |
| `layout.save` | Save Layout | Saves the current editor layout. |
| `layout.load` | Load Layout | Loads the saved editor layout.   |

You can trigger these via the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) or bind custom keys.

}
```

### Debugging
